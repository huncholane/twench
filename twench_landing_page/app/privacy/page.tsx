      <p>Effective Date: 10/27/24</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to TwenchRun! This Privacy Policy explains how we at TwenchRun
        (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collect, use, share, and protect your personal
        information. By accessing or using TwenchRun (the “Game”) or our
        associated website, you agree to the collection and use of your
        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        TwenchRun is a blockchain-based game that leverages the Twench
        cryptocurrency token on the Solana blockchain. Our goal is to provide a
        fun and engaging experience while respecting your privacy and
        safeguarding your information. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of
        information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your
        information.
      </p>

          participating in promotions or events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain Data:</strong> Due to the decentralized nature of
          blockchain technology, some information about your transactions is

            <li>Wallet address</li>

          Please note that blockchain data is public and cannot be deleted or
          altered after it is recorded.
        </li>
        <li>

            <li>Device type (e.g., mobile, desktop)</li>
            <li>Browser type and settings</li>
            <li>System configuration and version</li>

          This information helps us optimize the Game for different devices and

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the collected information in the following ways to provide and
        improve our services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>To Enable Game Functionality:</strong> Information such as
          game data and blockchain transaction details allow us to provide a
          seamless and functional gaming experience, including in-game purchases
          with Twench tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> Any transactions or
          interactions involving the Twench token are processed on the Solana
          blockchain. This enables transparency and decentralization but also
          makes transaction data publicly available and immutable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer Support and Communications:</strong> Your personal
          information enables us to provide efficient customer support and to
          communicate important updates, promotional materials, or responses to
          your queries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving User Experience:</strong> Game data and usage
          information help us understand how players interact with TwenchRun.
          This allows us to refine gameplay, personalize features, and improve
          overall usability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Compliance and Security:</strong> We may use your
          information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal
          obligations. Additionally, we employ security measures to help prevent
          unauthorized access to your data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
        However, there are instances where we may share your information with

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with third-party service
          providers to support our operations, including game hosting, payment
          processing, and analytics services. These providers only access your
          information as necessary to perform their tasks and are obligated to
          maintain its confidentiality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and Compliance Obligations:</strong> We may disclose
          your information if required to do so by law or if we believe that
          such action is necessary to comply with legal processes, protect the
          rights of our users, or ensure the safety and integrity of our Game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public Blockchain Data:</strong> Any transaction made on the
          Solana blockchain, including transactions related to TwenchRun, is
          recorded publicly and accessible to anyone. This data cannot be
          altered or deleted due to the decentralized nature of blockchain
          technology.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect and
        store from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and destruction. Our

      <ul>
